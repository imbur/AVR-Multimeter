# An ATmega-based multimeter

This project is about making a multimeter based on one of the AVR chips of the ATmega family.

## State of the project

Right now the project cannot be built without a lot of problems, this will change in the future. Until then, this is the placeholder for installation instructions.

## Software and hardware used

* Compiler: [avr-gcc](http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/)
* Programmer: USBtiny (programmed via [avrdude](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/avrdude))
* Tested chips: ATmega 328P, ATmega 324A (both DIP)
